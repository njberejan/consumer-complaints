Please launch the Jupyter Notebook file to view the results from this assignment. 

Within the notebook, you will find code which compiles the data from the provided data file into a Data Frame object.
Next, you will see code which converts the date received column to an index for use in determining the day of the week the 
complaint was issued (which is used to find the mean # of complaints by day of the week.)

Next, you will come across culling of data from the data frame into usable sets, and the accompanying graphs 
(in both bar and pie form!) which demonstrate the number of complaints by product, company, and company response. 
The final set of data and graphs as of this writing are supposed to show the mean number of complaints by day of the week;
however, I am not certain that this is what the numbers displayed are actually reflecting. It seems like it should be higher.

Thanks and enjoy!
